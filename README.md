# Flutter Daily Widgets Practice 💪

Welcome to the DailyFlash repository! This space is dedicated to my journey of mastering Flutter by diving deep into its widgets. Every day, I challenge myself to explore and practice at least 5 different Flutter widgets or 5 different designs UIs. 🚀

## Purpose 🎯

The core idea behind this repository is to create a vibrant platform for not just practicing Flutter widgets, but also enhancing the understanding of UI development within the Flutter ecosystem. By committing to daily practice, I aim to gain hands-on experience with a wide array of widgets, thereby improving my proficiency in crafting interactive and engaging user interfaces. 📱

## How to Use 🛠

1. Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhirdp/DailyFlash.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter IDE or editor.
3. Navigate to the `lib` directory to explore the different widget folders.
4. Each folder contains 5 separate Flutter widget examples. Dive into the widget files to study the code.
5. Run the app on an emulator or physical device to see the widget come to life.
6. Feel free to experiment with the code, tweak the widget, and observe the UI changes.
7. Make it a goal to practice with at least 5 different widgets every day. 💪
